In this Project we have loaded the statistics from football players of La Liga from different sources in order to cr√©ate a model which predicts the value of football players in LaLiga Fantasy game.

This Project was carried out to show a different view of a market (the market of the game) that sometimes it does not look like representing the real value of players. Some reasons are fama, errors by game predictors, influence of people on the market, etc.

The idea was to create a model to show the real price of a player according to as many features as possible.

Regression models have been used for this analysis and some visualizations can also be found in the code file. :)
